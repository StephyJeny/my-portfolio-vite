          I'm a passionate full-stack developer with expertise in cutting-edge technologies including React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Firebase. 
          I specialize in building Progressive Web Applications with advanced features like offline support, push notifications, and barcode scanning. 
          My technical arsenal includes modern frameworks (React, Remix), robust backend solutions (Firebase, RESTful APIs), 
          and comprehensive tooling (Vite, Webpack, ESLint). I excel at creating secure, scalable applications with JWT authentication, 
          real-time data visualization using Chart.js and D3, and seamless user experiences with responsive design. 
          Whether it's e-commerce platforms, loyalty management systems, or data dashboards, I deliver production-ready solutions 
          that combine technical excellence with business impact.
